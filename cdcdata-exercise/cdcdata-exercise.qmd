```{r}
# Initializing tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# CDC data of the percent of the population over 60 covered by RSV vaccine. Estimate is the percent vaccinated in the week for the specified state.

# Read data
data <- read.csv("rsv.csv", comment.char="#")

# Fiter to only include state level data and filter out NAs
data <- data %>% filter(Geographic.Level == 'State') %>% filter(!(is.na(Estimate)))

# Histogram of the estimates. Looks to be fairly normal
hist(data$Estimate)
# Mean of estimate
mean(data$Estimate)
# Standard deviation of estimate
sd(data$Estimate)

# Percentage of state
data %>% group_by(Geographic.Name) %>% summarise(percent = 100 * n() / 7168)

# Percentage of weeks
data %>% group_by(Week_ending) %>% summarise(percent = 100 * n() / 7168)
