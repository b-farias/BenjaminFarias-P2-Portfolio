You officially rationalized intrusion. Even if it is as you say it is (it isn't), it doesn't make up for the principal of the fact. True, google's algorithms can figure out a lot. Wtf do you think the government is using?! Bringing up how bad other governments are doesn't make what the government is doing ""okay"". If anything, the government knows that keeping it's people comfortable allows them far more freedom to fuck over other countries than if they wanted to treat us like they were N.Korea.

People will fight for their fake ""freedom"" (usa) a lot harder than for an imposing government (n.korea) (staying within the confines of your examples).

  Fast forward a couple months where I pay a separate company to come and check everything out. Third party tech finds the supply for the room severely kinked by a tie/strap. Essentially the installers ran duct work to the room that was too short. It was long enough to reach the register but with no slack to compensate for loss when suspended from the roof.  

It would have taken the techs from the original company 90 seconds in the attic to identify the problem, but they were so programmed into thinking ‚Äúit meets specs‚Äù and likely focused on some sort of service call/time or close rate metric they didn‚Äôt stop to consider anything else.",0,0

I'm going to make the rash assumption that you are new(ish) to SA and don't realize what happens in SA parks on holidays.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLm8dukRJk4

There's no hiking, per se. It's more of a huge drunken party.  All the local parks, but mainly Breckenridge lately, become a mass of extended families pitching tents and CAMPING in the city park for the duration of the holiday, trashing the place and not picking up after themselves, which takes the city workers 2 days of cleanup.

Google 'San Antonio Easter park camping' for pics showing thousands of people camping 5 feet from each other.  

That's the reason the parks are closed, because people can't behave and follow social distancing guidelines.   

The parks will be open again after the holiday weekend.

I have a friend who the sells you just took a security Plus and got a government he's making over 75k. Since he used to sell oil rig supplies.

I know you said you were looking to CDL license. Might want to try short term hauls like Laredo to San Antonio Houston maybe some parts of Louisiana. It is an expensive career choice I will say that I don't know that much about the field though so maybe ask on Reddit sure there's a form. 

I would suggest you just look at your community colleges see what they have to offer for electrician, mechanic, networking. See what they have for medical field surgical technician you can make a pretty good cash with that. You should be eligible for something with electrician for financial aid since it's a big demand.

For networking and cyber security San Antonio is a capital for that in Texas. Well then since the city is growing so fast electricians will be needed so you'll always have work with that. Same thing with plumbing, physical therapy people will always be getting old.

HVAC is a good demand stuff as well.

&gt; The attacker, dressed in black and wearing a ski mask and gloves, sprayed the place with bullets. Amber's mother was struck three times, and her brother-in-law was shot in the chest. A bullet just missed Amber's head. She fell down and played dead.
&gt; 
&gt; Miraculously, all survived.
&gt; 
&gt; At the court hearing the next day, prosecutors asked for a continuance. The trial was reset for the fall. Two days later, prosecutors drove to Killeen to meet with Amber and her mother at a battered women's shelter where they had gone to seek safety. Amber was terrified and no longer willing to testify.
&gt; 
&gt; Before the next court date, Williams absconded.
&gt; 
&gt; After about a year as a fugitive, Williams was found in the Dominican Republic. He was brought back to San Antonio in January 2017. This time, his bail was set at $450,000 and he had to surrender his passport.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Williams
&gt; The trial was held in San Antonio in November 2017 and lasted a week.
&gt; 
&gt; David Lunan, the lead prosecutor, had a wealth of evidence against Williams: the Backpage payment records, more than 330 ads, 26,000 cellphone texts, motel receipts. During the trial, it emerged that Williams ‚Äî while pimping Amber and Cooper ‚Äî was flirting online with hundreds of other girls.
&gt; 
&gt; Defense attorney Paul J. Smith tried to paint a picture of Williams, then 31, as a naive male duped by two conniving women who were in fact masterminds of a prostitution ring.
&gt; 
&gt; Those credit cards and gift cards and multiple cellphones found on his person? Williams was simply holding them for Cooper, who suspected Amber was stealing from her. The damning evidence on his own cellphone? His phone had been ""merged"" with Cooper's as part of an upgrade.
&gt; 
&gt; That online flirting with other girls? He was a man, and ""that's what men do,"" Williams testified.
&gt; Smith asked Amber on the stand whether Williams had ever twisted her arm or tied her up. She said he hadn't. But under state law, physical force isn't required to prove a defendant sexually exploited a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; When Williams testified in his own defense, he said Amber had come onto him, not the other way around, and had told him she wasn't a minor.
&gt; 
&gt; After the jurors found him guilty, Williams appealed to their mercy in the sentencing phase, saying he was a church-going man. He said he hadn't done anything extreme, like ""rape or murder.""
&gt; When Lunan asked Williams if he thought arranging for the repeated rape of a child comported with Christian values, Williams said it did not.
&gt; 
&gt; Lunan asked the jurors to sentence Williams to 40 years.
&gt; 
&gt; The jury came back with 50.
&gt; 
&gt; Williams is now a prisoner in Beeville. He is appealing his conviction and declined to be interviewed for this article.

&gt; Cooper, after entering into a plea bargain and agreeing testify against Williams, disappeared before the trial and is a fugitive.
&gt; 
&gt; Amber, now in her 20s, lives in another state. She declined to be interviewed, saying she'd wasted enough time on Williams and was trying to move on.
&gt; 
&gt; During the trial, she told the jury why she'd decided to testify. She was done, she said. Done with having panic attacks every time she saw a black Cadillac. Done with struggling to breathe whenever she saw a man who resembled Williams.
&gt; 
&gt; She stared down her erstwhile tormenter across the expanse of the courtroom.
&gt; 
&gt; ""I told myself I need to stop running,"" she said. ""I'm just tired of running. I'm tired of living in fear of you.""
&gt; About this story:
&gt; This narrative is based on the court record of Issac Lynn Williams' 2017 criminal trial, including the sworn testimony of Williams; Amber, the young woman he was convicted of trafficking; and the lead detective on the case. Quotes attributed to Williams and Amber are from the trial record.
&gt; 
&gt; The evidence includes emails and text messages between Williams, Amber and Williams' then-girlfriend, Deborah Ameia Cooper, as well as online ads promoting the women's availability for paid sex and the gift cards Williams used to pay for the ads. Also in the court record are Amber's handwritten notes describing her life under Williams' control, including the prices she was to charge for various sex acts. Amber ‚Äî the name she used while she was being trafficked ‚Äî asked that her identity and current state of residence not be revealed because she fears retaliation.",0,0

113,"Dude, that's awesome what you are doing and you are already on the right track.  A colleague of mine was very large like you around your same age.  He maintained an okay social life on the internet but was depressed often.  He started college but ended up having to drop out because his grandfather died and was the breadwinner for his household.  His father left him when he was about 5 or 6 years old I believe.  When his grandfather passed away due to complications involving his weight, it was a wake up call for him.  His grandfather gave him a ring from when he was younger before he passed and he made it his goal to loose enough weight to fit that ring.  He started loosing weight by marching in place everyday in his room until he was winded.  Those sessions grew longer and longer.  Eventually he realized that he had a bad habit of snacking whenever he did anything such as play video games, watch tv, etc even though he wasn't hungry.  To fix this, he would pause and think before he had a snack and asked himself if he was really hungry or if he was just giving in to his bad habit of snacking for no reason.  If he wasn't hungry, he would just chew on ice chips.  With those two things alone as well as somewhat keeping track of calories, he has lost close to 200 lbs.  He carries before and after as well as progress pictures with him on his phone everywhere he goes and looks at them from time to time to keep him motivated.  he also still wears the same belt that he had when he was larger.  Every time he puts a new hole in it to make it fit smaller he has a little celebration by having a really good cheat meal.  He now has 17 holes in that belt.  It's definitely possible to achieve what you want and I hope this story as well as these tips helps you out.  Good luck and I wish you good health and a long life.

It is possible to find a studio apartment in SA for about $550/month.

Minimum wage works out to about $1,160/month.

Meaning that after rent a person has $610 to pay for everything else. Food, gas, car, insurance, healthcare, phone, electricity, water, everything.

So the total cost per piece of avocado toast is about 35 cents. Two for breakfast is 70 cents. \*\*THAT\*\* is the platonic example of how wasteful young people are spending their money on frivolities? Spending less than a dollar for breakfast is bad now Boomers?",0,0

[FDA](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-euas) released a list of N95/KN95 manufacturers that are Emergency Use Authorized (EUA).

The National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL) has conducted [assessments](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respirators/testing/NonNIOSHresults.html) regard to the FDA approved manufacture so you know the filtering efficiency rate. Regular mask tests cannot detect whether the mask can actually filter particles or not (water test, fire test, etc). For masks like KN95 and N95, it's better to go off with the NPPTL assessment since they have the proper equipment to test the BFE or PFE.

/r/funny banes tumbler and even reddit.com. That's right, you can't link to a reddit url on /r/funny.

/r/pics has all sorts of restrictions on content. 

/r/sports bans all blogs. Why? Because blogs, like MYSA are designed to generate clicks. 

/r/aww bans (Facebook, Twitter, etc.)

These are not outliers, these are default subs, and just about every single one of them bans submissions from this or that source and all of them strictly curtail what sorts of content they will allow. 

So the idea that reddit is all about some free market of ideas where the up and down arrows choose what is and is not displayed is demonstrably false. Just like the best news rooms have strong editorial guidelines, so must the best subreddits.

Now imagine going somewhere, then coming back.  You'd need nearly 4 hours of free time to be able to do that.

The two things that can fix this more easily are reducing the number of stops the bus makes, and increasing the frequency.  You go to Germany or Spain and the bus doesn't stop every quarter mile.  It stops maybe once every mile or so.  So if you have a 10 mile trip from around the city to downtown, it isn't going to stop literally 40 times (I know, it only actually stops when people are at the stop to get on, or when someone pulls the cord, but still on a busy bus just imagine).

But I can tell you that in person jury trials are way more efficient. We have so many issues with Zoom trials in practice that it's crazy. I had a girl crawl into a room to coach a witness. I've had two witnesses use earbuds so they could get answers. In one instance, we noticed a juror mute and turn off her camera. Turns out she went to work. You see all those Reddit threads complaining about ISPs? Man, connectivity issues can create chaos. As a future court reporter, you will prefer everyone be present in person, lol.

Jury selection is much faster in person and, in my experience as a seasoned trial attorney, more effective at producing a truly fair jury. My longest trial was 14 days, so 2 and a half work weeks. That involved trying offenses from the 1980s and late 2000s simultaneously. Horribly complicated case. By Zoom, it would've been a month or more.

But this is exactly how scientists believe it spread through some of the cruise ships that maintained strict quarantine methods, through the ship's AC systems. In some cases they believe it was the primary cause (in other situations it was very poor crew procedures with them gathering in the mess hall or other areas spreading to each other, then to passengers during food delivery before they became symptomatic and detected).

The 6-feet rule is good, but that's on the assumption larger droplets from a sneeze/cough fall downwards and aren't carried around on air currents. Ultra-fine droplets from normal exhalation behave differently in the air and don't rapidly settle. (Humans exhale a cup or more of water per day) Outside it's a low-risk issue because they disperse, but indoors not so much, the concentration builds as people eat/drink. 

Then you start adding in AC and fan currents which will keep heavier droplets airborne longer or funnel lighter ones around the building as they did in the cruise ships between cabins... In the Texas heat everybody has either the AC, fans, or both cranked up.

(Reading the CBO report)[https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-02/56975-Minimum-Wage.pdf] on the effects of minimum wage is actually pretty interesting.  It strikes me as it will generally be a boon to the country and our people.  

tl;dr - a little more income to the lowest earners is generally spent in the local community. Food, home improvements, electronics, clothing, vehicles, etc.   It basically stimulates the local economy.  That stimulates the business owners they buy from, and that stimulates the tax coffers of the municipalities, and that leads to better roads and schools and police and fire departments and other services people depend on.  It's a trickle-up effect. 



&gt; The problem with liberal policies is that they come from a place of good will but in practice don't function at all. If you want healthcare and education stop sending troops overseas, stop bombing foreign countries, stop forcing the economy to be energy dependent on foreign entities, stop having people like aoc vote on bills to supply other nations with gender studies money and put all of that back into the national economy and workforce.

I agree that liberals are a generally a little too hawkish for my taste, but I hope that's merely pandering.  It seems like many progressive politicians ARE talking about reducing troops overseas and not be so eager to go to war. The benefit would be that we could better afford to actually care for our veterans. The last four years have been rough on veterans AND active duty alike.   I guess what I'm trying to say is that the progressives I see are advocating for reduced military spending and reliance of foreign entities (domestic oil, solar, hydro and wind power was big even as far back as 2008 under Obama, so reducing the foreign reliance is there, and hopefully growing).   These liberal policies have proven themselves to actually work. 


Trump signing the Omnibus bill with the USAID ""(gender studies)[https://www.usaid.gov/pakistan/cross-cutting-themes-good-governance-and-gender-equity]"" package actually surprised me.   I am a big fan of finding out why there's so much violence against women there, and how it can be reduced  (overly simplified, I suspect religion and education. Reduce the former and increase the latter would do wonders).  At the same time, I am really interested in how we can reduce foreign aid in general. 
We spend billions every year on Israel and Egypt and Pakistan and several other countries.  If we could cut that in half (and billions to Israel - an apartheid country? That seems a little counter to our values!) we would have plenty of money for healthcare and education for our own citizens here at home. 

&gt; 
&gt; The only people that benefit from a minimum wage increase are the massive corporations that can withstand the reduction in profit. Ie amazon, google etc. The same people that made billions off of covid shutdowns are the same people supporting the politicians backing these policies and are trying to silence free speech.
&gt; 

Well, they lobbied against it hard, until the bad press cost them more.  Then they found out (in the case of Amazon) that offering decent money gave them a lot more and a lot better applicants, so they actually do benefit from it.  And then GOOD press they get for tweeting things like ""we challenge our competitors to match us, or one better, pay $16 and throw the gauntlet back at us"" as I think Bezos or some Amazon dude tweeted.  Hell, BofA pays $20. 

Ultimately I think we're in the wrong here thinking that raising the minimum wage should be so low nobody can live off of it, so we don't accidentally give large corporations more money.  That's punishing people to try to spite a large corporation.  That's not good either.

Uhh.  You might want to read the book ""[Dark Money"" by Jane Mayer](https://bookshop.org/books/dark-money-the-hidden-history-of-the-billionaires-behind-the-rise-of-the-radical-right/9780307947901) - it details how pretty much all the entities you mentioned have large influx of both money and influence by conservative causes.  Certainly not all, but overwhelmingly. 

The very point paragraph you wrote above indicates that they're successful in keeping it hidden from 'common knowledge'. 

I'm a capitalist and a fan of The Nordic Model, so I really don't have too much of a problem companies making good money, as long as the people are also lifted by the rising tide.  THAT is what I want to ensure happens, and that's why I pin my hopes on some of the progressive politicians that seem to think of it in a similar way. 

Make people richer and their communities will thrive, and if they thrive, they spend more money and then the companies thrive, and they can pay their employees and then we have a virtuous circle.  It's a little like the tax rates back in the 40s and 50s - a time when the US was truly a superpower with infrastructure and innovation coming at us fast. 

&gt; 
&gt; You elevate the community by elevating the individual. You don't elevate the community by taking from those that work and giving to those that don't. Wealth redistribution (covid ""relief"" packages where only 8% actually goes to covid relief) does not work. You're telling people they know nothing about economics but you need to learn some history my friend. Socialism and communism never work.

This is what I've been trying to say.  The last four years of grift has just impoverished the large masses, while enriching the very few at the top - the very wealth distribution you're against (see the Trump Tax Cut as a prime example - yikes!).   We need to encourage people to work and part of that is to ensure that they get paid for it and not just screwed over by the companies they work for. 

I don't actually know how little of Trump's relief was helpful or went where it should have, but the recent plan has a good chunk of money going to actually get people past the pandemic.  Or hopefully will. 
The part about 8% seems a little shady.  By the time you figure in over 400 billion in stimulus checks, almost 250 billion for unemployment and federal supplement, and 130 billion for safe school reopenings, and 160 billion for vaccine production and distribution and PPE, we get pretty far over the 8% number you quote. 

There are some people that are concerned that the childcare credit isn't COVID related and shouldn't be in there, but the people who qualify for this are also largely overlapping with people who would benefit from an increased minimum wage, etc. 

Economics.  The ultimate ""facts don't care about your feelings"" subject.  :D 


Socialism and communism might have their downside.  I don't think we've seen TOO much communist tendencies, despite the last four years (that's more despotism, nepotism and cronyism).  Socialism is something that is huge in our country (the US - I'm assuming you're American here).  Look at the military - stripped down to its core, it's a jobs program. 

""Give us x amount of years to do what we tell you and we'll give you housing, insurance, food and clothing"". 

We have social security - it's in the name.   My taxes pay for schools, sidewalks, police and fire departments and infrastructure. Some of which I'll be lucky to never use.   I'd argue that it works, but could work better.   

If we could reign in some of the pork in the bills and eliminate lobbying and cronyism and grift from government, aka ""draining the swamp"", it would probably work a whole lot better.   I keep referring back to the last four years, because they have been a prime example of how to do your best to ruin a country by grift and theft and shady alliances, instead of doing what's better for everyone. 

Now we just need to keep voting in better politicians who actually have OUR interests at heart, and toss them out the moment their lies and bullshit comes to light.",0,0

It's a little like the tax rates back in the 40s and 50s - a time when the US was truly a superpower with infrastructure and innovation coming at us fast. 

&gt; 
&gt; You elevate the community by elevating the individual. You don't elevate the community by taking from those that work and giving to those that don't. Wealth redistribution (covid ""relief"" packages where only 8% actually goes to covid relief) does not work. You're telling people they know nothing about economics but you need to learn some history my friend. Socialism and communism never work.

This is what I've been trying to say.  The last four years of grift has just impoverished the large masses, while enriching the very few at the top - the very wealth distribution you're against (see the Trump Tax Cut as a prime example - yikes!).   We need to encourage people to work and part of that is to ensure that they get paid for it and not just screwed over by the companies they work for. 

I don't actually know how little of Trump's relief was helpful or went where it should have, but the recent plan has a good chunk of money going to actually get people past the pandemic.  Or hopefully will. 
The part about 8% seems a little shady.  By the time you figure in over 400 billion in stimulus checks, almost 250 billion for unemployment and federal supplement, and 130 billion for safe school reopenings, and 160 billion for vaccine production and distribution and PPE, we get pretty far over the 8% number you quote. 

There are some people that are concerned that the childcare credit isn't COVID related and shouldn't be in there, but the people who qualify for this are also largely overlapping with people who would benefit from an increased minimum wage, etc. 

Economics.  The ultimate ""facts don't care about your feelings"" subject.  :D 


Socialism and communism might have their downside.  I don't think we've seen TOO much communist tendencies, despite the last four years (that's more despotism, nepotism and cronyism).  Socialism is something that is huge in our country (the US - I'm assuming you're American here).  Look at the military - stripped down to its core, it's a jobs program. 

""Give us x amount of years to do what we tell you and we'll give you housing, insurance, food and clothing"". 

We have social security - it's in the name.   My taxes pay for schools, sidewalks, police and fire departments and infrastructure. Some of which I'll be lucky to never use.   I'd argue that it works, but could work better.   

If we could reign in some of the pork in the bills and eliminate lobbying and cronyism and grift from government, aka ""draining the swamp"", it would probably work a whole lot better.   I keep referring back to the last four years, because they have been a prime example of how to do your best to ruin a country by grift and theft and shady alliances, instead of doing what's better for everyone.

No amount of ""practiced"" multitasking will make it safe for a person to drive while talking or texting. As some comments have mentioned, it is not so much keeping the hands free but more of not being distracted while driving. I do not have the research readily available but studies have shown that while driving, our attention threshold is limited and driving accounts for nearly all the focused attention used. Any external activity will usually overload that focused attention and compromise any other activity. Specifically, if your driving and you decide to pay more attention to your phone than the road, your driving suffers and others are put in danger. ",1,1

It doesn't get that hot here (100ish, give or take) in the summer, but it's the *humidity* that kills me.  Walking outside feels like stepping into a sauna. You sweat and get sticky instantly.

You may be used to this in Ohio, so the winters here would be your happy place. It's less muggy and we rarely get below freezing for long. Snow is extremely rare and even ice days (roads closed when it rains while being below freezing) are very rare. 

The weather related issue that stands out is tires. Because of the generally dry climate, people use cheap, shitty and used tires. Tires on cars here are often bald (yeah, so I generally pay attention in parking lots) so a sprinkle of rain and it's vehicular bowling.

Ice days are to keep you home so other drivers don't careen into you.

346,"I went to a school at KSAT but it's no longer there. Wouldn't recommend it anyway. 

If you don't mind driving out to Boerne you can get trained out there and save tons of cash. The airspace is not controlled so you don't have to waste so much time and money waiting around on the taxiway and getting routed out of the SAT Class C airspace. Google 5C1 (the airport code). 

If that is not an option then check out a school at Stinson municipal. That is a towered airport but it's own Class D which is at the south edge of the busy airspace so you can get out quickly. 

This all matters because you pay for the plane and the instructor by the hour and you can spend 30+ minutes just taxiing and flying far enough away from KSAT to do your lessons. If money was no object, it does at least have the advantage of honing your radio skills very well. 

Let me know if you have more questions. Good luck.

**Herd Immunity**

One of the most common questions I see is ‚Äúwhen will we hit herd immunity?‚Äù

I may be an oddity, but I do not think it‚Äôs an important number to focus on.  Here is why.

Herd immunity is not the end of the outbreak, it is the turning point.  Mathematically, herd immunity is defined as the point when the number of infected people begins to decline.  But infections will continue to occur, and people will continue to die.

Herd immunity is highly variable over time, and it is very dependent on our behaviors.  If the public completely locked down, isolated, and wore hazmat suits all the time, herd immunity would be a very low threshold.  If the public frequently attend large, packed gatherings in enclosed spaces without any protection, the herd immunity threshold would be extremely high.

In fact, we‚Äôve already achieved herd immunity a number of times as our behaviors have varied widely and infections peaked and then declined.  The three easily visible peaks occurred in April 2020, July 2020, and January 2021.  We‚Äôre now seeing an uptick in cases, probably due to relaxed behaviors, and despite the vaccination efforts.

So, rather than focusing on a very hard to measure herd immunity threshold, I think it‚Äôs better to focus on seeing cases and hospitalizations go to zero within Texas.  It‚Äôs an end point, and it‚Äôs much easier to measure.

To that end, I have added a chart that shows hospitalizations in Texas, as well as a trendline derived from the last 12 weeks.  The title shows the expected number of years to eliminate hospitalizations in Texas given our recent trend.

These time projections can change significantly and rapidly, so don't expect precision or consistency.  Just watch it on a regular basis and over time you should get an idea of the potential time range for eradication.",0,0

375,"It is, but there are other problems beyond just those people dying. Health care capacity is the main concern if we just look at it from a statistics point of view and ignore the ""every life is priceless"" argument. The entire premise of flattening the curve was that with the level of infectivity this virus has if it's left to run as it would naturally you end up with people dying because the health care system becomes overwhelmed. People that wouldn't have died normally are now dying because all the ICU beds are full, because hospitals run out of supplies. Got in a car accident and need to be in the ICU where you would normally recover if you receive that level of care? Sorry, no ICU beds, perhaps you still make it, maybe you don't. 

Yes, it's more deadly for people in certain age demographics, and those with certain underlying conditions, but they aren't the only ones ending up in the hospital or the ICU. Younger people and those without underlying health conditions do still end up in the hospital and some in the ICU, even some on ventilators. Most survive, though we don't know of the long term effects yet. So now if the health care system is overwhelmed and there aren't enough beds/resources to care for those non-high risk people who happen to get really sick but normally pull through they start dying as well. Once we lose the ability for everyone who needs that level of care to get it the mortality rate goes up.

The answer, as usual, will probably be somewhere between the two extremes. Shutting down everything for 18 months isn't an option, but on the flip side throwing the doors open is insane. For example, why are bars open at all? They are by their nature a perfect environment for spreading the virus.

Texas is setting record numbers day after day for COVID-19 hospitalizations. Not just positive tests, hospitalizations, if that trend continues like we saw in New York a lot of people are going to die, for what?

The state has a lot of interesting dashboards around COVID-19. I would recommend taking a look at them, look at the trends based on how people have been behaving the last few weeks(memorial day, busy bars, protests, etc.)

* BHL is beginner league on Tuesday's which is a 10 game season that runs about $220 (about to expand to 6 teams though, and possibly a different night or an ultra late game).
* The ARL which is the ""rec league"" that plays on Wednesday/Fridays.  Unsure of season length but it will run about $20/week x duration.
* The AHL which is the competitive league that plays on Thursday/Sunday.  Also unsure of length/cost.

You get a lot of cross over in these leagues due to the limited ice time.  BHL is a newer league that the learn to play sessions were converted into b/c we had so many people.  Unfortunately for you that means you can't just come out and pay $20 for a single session like it was last year.  The shorter season cuts down on the cost a bit though.

If you are having an issue with costs reach out to Dale Henry, he is the hockey director and I'm fairly certain they will let you work out a payment plan if that is what works for you.

Depending on how busy the ice is, since it is the only sheet in town for all activities, drop-in and stick and puck times vary.  You will have to check their schedule (http://northwoodsice.maxgalaxy.net/Schedule.aspx?ID=6) to see when they are having them.  There used to be Wed drop-in but the ARL took that slot to accommodate 6 teams.

There are also a few groups of guys who will pool together and rent out private ice.  10 skaters per team plus goalies, usually for $21 each.  There are facebook groups for this.

I was part of the opening ceremony when they remade downtown. The city sits in a valley, in the shadow of Mt. Diablo. Part of what makes the city so popular are the building laws. If I remember correctly, a percentage of the city must remain in its natural form, which limits the amount of houses and buildings.

Tre‚Ä¶ lost major points in my book when all their pasta has started coming out salty. Took my mom and dad there for a lunch treat during restaurant weeks and ordered the wine pairing. It was a glass of wine with each of the three courses. When the waiter failed to bring out one of the glasses of wine, and we asked for it, he told me that there were only wine pairings for two of the three courses. We asked for the menus and he said it was clearly stated there were only two and walked away. Never saw the menus. Had to google their lunch time restaurant weeks menu and show him‚Ä¶ which then prompted him to bring us that wine. Mind you- still got charged. No discount, nothing, after having to argue with the waiter. So‚Ä¶ that and the incredibly salty pasta of late‚Ä¶ kinda ruined it for me. And it truly was my favorite spot in town!",0,0

&gt;We both like cycling (road and mtb), hiking, camping and going on weekend trips to nearby destinations.

Cycling is def covered (there is an 85-mile paved greenway that goes all over the city and it's *great*). There is great camping and hiking a short drive out of the city (esp west/northwest/north). Some *really* good day trips/weekend trips available: Austin, Fredericksburg (Texas wine country), 2-3 hours to some really solid beaches, Kerrville (folk festival, river stuff), Canyon Lake, etc.  


&gt;I enjoy gardening and history related things.

Some cool native plants that do really well here. Understand, it is *very*, very hot. We are in Hardiness Zone 8b if you want to google and see what does well here *naturally*. Other things will do fine, but know too that we are regularly under some significant watering restrictions, at least this summer. LOTS of cool history stuff here in south central Texas. The missions, Gonzalez TX, history museums, etc.  


&gt;Food.

You'll be fine. I recently found a fantastic Thai place that I'm going to give a lot of money. Amazing Mexican and BBQ, of course, and more and more upscale dining is coming to the ""cool"" parts of town (Southtown, The Pearl, etc.). The part of town you are in will matter. I'm not too far from the Medical Center and there seems to be a lot more variety over here as opposed to where you work will be located.  


&gt;We both would enjoy somewhere that is more ""greener"" and more established.

You'll find more established, large-tree lots between 410 and 1604 (north/south boundary), and I10 and Thousand Oaks (east/west boundary), and I think in your budget. There are some great parks and green spaces in the northwest and central parts of that block, and the [Howard Peak Greenway](https://www.sanantonio.gov/Portals/0/Files/Parks/Linear%20Creekways/HWP%20Greenway%20Trail%20Map.pdf?ver=2022-04-21-092311-137) runs all throughout. The northwest side will start to get far from your work (it's about 25 minutes right now with no traffic), but I think it's still doable. Like you said, it's very much a car-centric city and we have a pretty solid road system.

Anyway, I'm a big fan and enjoy a lot of the same things as you and your wife. Think you could really enjoy it. Best of luck! Cheers!",0,0

Are you immaculately cleaning the restaurant (including restrooms) every day, between meals and as required?

Have you considered changing the confrontational tone you take in your Google review responses?

How do you elevate your customer's experience from anywhere else? What differentiates you as a restaurant?

Haha none of this gives any reason why the business owner is racist. Calling people racist with absolutely zero evidence makes you an asshole.

Racist should be a serious term, not something you throw out as a buzzword. You're devaluing this word and hurting the actual victims of racism in the world.

&gt;anyways, when you troll, come up with something more original. also, please stop projecting. if you live with your mom, thats fine. a lot of millennials are doing that nowadays. no need to bring people down to your level though ;)

Your arguments hold no weight whatsoever. Honestly, I hope you're trolling because I didn't think people who claim everything is racist like you do actually existed. Your argument can be boiled down to, Trump and all of his supporters are racist because I say so, and if you disagree you're just a basement dweller at your moms house, correct?

Programming the usage allows for us to only have it on when necessary and change the temps throughout the day/night.  Once you get your temps and programs down, you probably won't have to touch the thermostat every again.

People often get the program confused with the Peak Savers program, which allows CPS to control your home temp without any override options only during peak times and days.  This was unpopular for obvious reasons.  Not even sure if it's still around.

Now with the Home Manager program, there is fine print that states that CPS can still change your temp during peak times and days, HOWEVER, you ARE able to override it with Home Manager and change your temp back to any setting you'd like.

I guess some conspiracy theorists out there may argue that this is the first step toward major utilities controlling consumer usage.  I think we're a loooong way from that though. 

I only have good things to say about this program.  The online system works well and the app (iOS version, not sure about Android) is simple to use.

562,"Thank you for the reply. 

As a younger man I did a lot of side work and consulting for different groups, but the pay was always at a lower rate than my corporate job. I've seen two replies now stating that a small scale operation should have equal compensation to the largest scale education systems. :( 

So if you were offered a position with a small church or home setting to teach only 4 children instead of 20+, you would need to make equal to a district position?  Or do you think more pay is required since you lose the TRS benefit? I understand the desire to not go backwards in your career, but the scope of work is significantly smaller, isn't it? Am I missing something major about the position I have not considered? 

One of my friends graduated a few years ago and finished her student classroom hours, but she is teaching at a church pre-school for just a couple of dollars over minimum wage. I guess I just had some wildly incorrect conclusions based off of the education friends I have on Facebook.

I think I'm going to give up while I'm ahead. I don't know what I'm going to do when school opens. I have already had two family members catch covid and it's no joke. :(

575,"&gt; Saying ""don't bother"" is a surefire way to ensure that no fibre network will ever be built in San Antonio.

Nonsense. Google would commission market studies that take into account things like household income and housing density, as well as their own *extensive* internal repository of ad/user data. The number/location of self-selected respondents to a web ""form"" proves nothing. Half of those people won't live in the same place in 5 years, so even if Google miraculously decided this weekend to bless San Antonio with fiber, it'd take longer than 5 years to start offering service here, because this city's so vast. What matters is demographics - Is there a critical mass of people in the market who are likely to be interested in purchasing the product and who can afford it? Do they live close enough together that we can get them the fiber cost-effectively?

Google is probably keenly aware that San Antonio *already* has a Texas-based [overbuild](http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/21/local/me-15136) TV/broadband provider that COULDN'T MAKE THE ECONOMICS WORK to expand its territory outside of Loop 410. I live in a neighborhood outside of 410 that has been wired for Grande. All they'd have to do is connect a trunk line to it and my neighborhood could be in their territory without having to bury a single cable. They can't make the economics work to do that. To me, THAT is the biggest reason we won't be anywhere near the top of the list if/when they expand the project. If a company that knows this city's quirky demographics couldn't make a go of overbuild service, then this probably isn't a good place to try an overbuild.

Even though this city has a lot of people it's really a small town. It most definitely doesn't have a Paris or London vibe to it. I would compare it more to the country than the city in almost all ways except for the traffic. Glasgow might actually be a decent comparison to make but we're not as metropolitan or diverse as Berlin.

This isn't a media or tech hub by any means. What I mean is that there aren't really that many tech companies around here (we have a tough time hiring the amount of talent that we need) and there's not the same computer culture that there is in other cities. It's very much a blue collar country town.

But the cost of living is less here than in Austin or other towns which sets you up for more financial success as you're not going to be paying out as much in rent, gas, etc as you would somewhere else.

As far as UT vs UTSA I would say that neither are prestigious universities when it comes to tech. But I don't think it really matters as much as people think it does. The best thing you can do while in university is to get as much experience as you can.

Not that mental illnesses ,homelessness and crime didn't exists before I was born but nowhere near as severe as it is nowadays and it's getting worse every day. 
Yes I take into consideration that we're more people on this planet than 50 years ago. 
So what has changed?  It all starts in your childhood.  Parents who take away children's responsibilities,  raise them as narcissist , feeding them with low quality food and sodas , let them play violent video games , let them be part of the social media world at a young age etc led to this problem as well.  When I was a teenager some of the problems already existed so the apple doesn't fall from the tree.  There's a lack of discipline and good behaviors that are taught children.  
You're making this way too political well then let me ask you why are liberal cities too soft on crime. Catch and release is the Democrats new strategy just take a look at the Westcoast states that didn't work out too well. If there aren't consequences in crime such as drug abuse , shop lifting ect that only creates a haven for mentally ill people that's why cities like that dealing with all these problems.  Nobody enforces the laws.  No fear of consequences.  
Drug abuse: yes Marijuana can be used for medical purposes and it helps people who are in pain. 
I don't agree on legalizing it because it's just another drug that messes with your brain and we already have enough of that legally. Everything adds up. 
Money: People feel they have to keep up with the Jones and that's where social media comes in the pressure of having less than the people I see and know. You think you deserve the same that's where you buy a car that represents your fake financial situation.  You know you're paying too much and you don't want to but if I drive a low trim Toyota Corolla people don't take me serious . Then there's this new iPhone every 2 years and it goes on and on. People spent way too much money on unnecessary things and find themselves in a situation where they live pay check to paycheck.  The pay isn't the real issue is how you do the math. 
You want to make good money get educated or work a job that requires a lot of flexibility and work long hours but people rather want to be lazy . So homelessness people are usually the weak folks that don't want to fit in. How can we help?  I agree to investing more in mental health but at the same time the government has to be harder on crime and say no to socialism.",0,0

The downsides to San Antonio are far and few between, the biggest being the amount of uninsured drivers, but a solid insurance policy will protect you from that.  This is one of the few areas growing economically, the price of housing is more akin to a small town, the locals are very nice and also despise the stereotypical example of poor gang affiliated Hispanic thugs.

**Herd Immunity**

One of the most common questions I see is ‚Äúwhen will we hit herd immunity?‚Äù

I may be an oddity, but I do not think it‚Äôs an important number to focus on.  Here is why.

Herd immunity is not the end of the outbreak, it is the turning point.  Mathematically, herd immunity is defined as the point when the number of infected people begins to decline.  But infections will continue to occur, and people will continue to die.

Herd immunity is highly variable over time, and it is very dependent on our behaviors.  If the public completely locked down, isolated, and wore hazmat suits all the time, herd immunity would be a very low threshold.  If the public frequently attend large, packed gatherings in enclosed spaces without any protection, the herd immunity threshold would be extremely high.

In fact, we‚Äôve already achieved herd immunity a number of times as our behaviors have varied widely and infections peaked and then declined.  The three easily visible peaks occurred in April 2020, July 2020, and January 2021.  We‚Äôre now seeing an uptick in cases, probably due to relaxed behaviors, and despite the vaccination efforts.

So, rather than focusing on a very hard to measure herd immunity threshold, I think it‚Äôs better to focus on seeing cases and hospitalizations go to zero within Texas.  It‚Äôs an end point, and it‚Äôs much easier to measure.

To that end, I have added a chart that shows hospitalizations in Texas, as well as a trendline derived from the last 12 weeks.  The title shows the expected number of years to eliminate hospitalizations in Texas given our recent trend.

These time projections can change significantly and rapidly, so don't expect precision or consistency.  Just watch it on a regular basis and over time you should get an idea of the potential time range for eradication.",0,0

844,"Robert Flores first fell in love with Fred‚Äôs Fish Fry back in high school when he used to hit the pokey little takeout joint that‚Äôs still afloat in a sea of auto parts scrapyards on Somerset Road.

Decades later, the 65-year-old still heeds the sweet siren call of Fred‚Äôs rectangular fish fillets, round shrimp pieces and their famous tartar sauce. Now, at least once a week, he and his wife hit the Fred‚Äôs at 6323 Old Pearsall Road, a downright palatial location in comparison to what will always be his seafood pride of the South Side.

‚ÄúCheck this out. So when I was in the military, I was gone for 14 years,‚Äù Flores said. ‚ÄúWhere do you think the first place I went to when I came back? No lie, Fred‚Äôs Fish.‚Äù

The South and West Side institution is still dishing out the same fish and chips after more than 50 years and despite the persistent rumor that the chain is a drug front or some other criminal cover-up to explain its apparent lack of customers or cars in the parking lot. That rumor has circulated for decades and now is the basis for several memes on social media.

Why don‚Äôt you see cars in the lot? Most customers get takeout, and several locations don‚Äôt even have a dining room.

That takeout now is the stuff of San Antonio legend, a tradition carried out for generations one greasy, three-piece shrimp and fish platter-filled box at a time.

Take the Fred‚Äôs at 603 N. Zarzamora Street. In just one late afternoon hour, the West Side location saw multiple demographic groups dive in for an order of fried seafood with a heaping side of memories to-go.

Delia Gonzales, a 32-year-old mom with her 6-year-old son, proudly declared she swings by every other day and has loved the shrimp, onion rings and just about anything else at Fred‚Äôs since she was 17. Ditto Jose Gutierrez, 65, retired from the Army and the Marines who‚Äôs been a Fred‚Äôs fan through high school, Vietnam and two trips around the world.

Then there was Beatrice Perez, a 70-year-old grandmother with her 9-year-old grandson. She professed a similar love for Fred‚Äôs three-piece fish order, a love that goes back to her 20s.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a family tradition,‚Äù Gutierrez said. ‚Äú ‚ÄòHey, let‚Äôs go to Fred‚Äôs.‚Äô ‚Äù

On ExpressNews.com: San Antonio‚Äôs Pig Stand diner has a heart that won‚Äôt quit

What started in 1963 with a single fish fry on the 4800 block of Roosevelt Avenue has quietly spawned to a school of 16 Alamo City locations, more than the number of area Long John Silver‚Äôs and Sea Island Shrimp House locations combined.

Most Fred‚Äôs takeout meals come in a basic 5- by 7-inch box with a Fred‚Äôs logo. The seafood platters ‚Äî ranging from $10.05 for two fried pieces each of shrimp, oysters and white fish to $47.04 for a dozen pieces each of shrimp and fish ‚Äî include tartar sauce, ketchup and bread. Prices aside, it‚Äôs been the same since pretty much the beginning.

The distinctive Fred‚Äôs sign ‚Äî a gray fish leaping out of green water ‚Äî has been the same since the early 1970s. And the menu still sports photos and prices of Fred‚Äôs signature fish and shrimp, still battered and breaded by the same company the Castellanos refuse to name but who they say refuses to work with anyone else.

Even the name behind the business remains relatively unchanged. The seafood legacy of late founding father Alfred Castellano Sr. and his son Alfred Castellano Jr. now carries on with Alfred Castellano III and his sister Teresa Castellano.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve got two helpers here. Well, two bosses now,‚Äù said Castellano Jr., 75. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm semi-retired.‚Äù

Seated in a conference room at the Fred‚Äôs main office and processing plant, just down the road from that location on Somerset, the Castellanos served up the kind of secrets to success that sound about as square as their fish fillets: Avoid the middleman, don‚Äôt get into debt and never fix what isn‚Äôt broken. The Castellanos have stuck by that simple and consistent recipe since Castellano Sr. died in 1971.

The Castellanos say they save money by buying seafood directly from fisheries and processing and distributing it themselves. They also buy and build on the property of every Fred‚Äôs location, which they own instead of lease.

And those locations, which already bear a small footprint, bear an equally small staff. The busier Fred‚Äôs restaurants may have up to four employees at a time, Castellano III said, while the tinier walk-ups have spells where they get along just fine with a single staffer.

‚ÄúSo when people question a lot, we‚Äôre just not splurging on stuff we don‚Äôt need,‚Äù said Castellano III, who added that such misconceptions about Fred‚Äôs are a big reason why the company doesn‚Äôt bother with social media.

‚ÄúWe sell a good product, and it‚Äôs all the same,‚Äù Castellano Jr. said. ‚ÄúAll the stores you go to, it should be the same.‚Äù

‚Äú(As a kid) I remember vividly on Fridays my dad would always get Fred‚Äôs Fish Fry,‚Äù Herrera said. ‚Äú(For) our parents‚Äô generation, that was the place for fried fish.‚Äù

A few years ago, he struck up a friendship with the Castellanos and toured their facility where they make the bulk of their menu items in-house. ‚ÄúMe being a chef, to me it‚Äôs amazing that they‚Äôve kept up this legacy going for such a long time,‚Äù he said.

He was so impressed, he took to Facebook to promote the brand, making it the No. 7 reason to love the South Side, a clap back at the persistent drug-front stigma.

The Castellanos have heard it before, and shake their heads with a weary laugh.

‚ÄúLet me tell you something,‚Äù Castellano Jr. said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt do stuff like that.‚Äù

Castellano Jr., who was a former chairman of San Antonio‚Äôs Firefighters‚Äô and Police Officers‚Äô Civil Service Commission, said such rumors about Fred‚Äôs don‚Äôt bother him because a) only ‚Äúpeople who are stupid‚Äù make up such stories and b) he can assure that ‚Äúthe police and everybody else has looked at it and checked us out, (and) we have no problems.‚Äù

The law sure seems to back him up. The San Antonio Police Department replied to an Express-News inquiry into such rumors by noting its narcotics division has no record of issues at any Fred‚Äôs Fish Fry locations.

‚ÄúI think the big charm to Fred‚Äôs is when you grew up on the West Side and the South Side, that‚Äôs what you could afford,‚Äù Herrera said. ‚ÄúWhen you go to Fred‚Äôs you feel like you‚Äôre back home, all those memories and that good stuff. That‚Äôs the great thing about food, and that‚Äôs the great thing about having something consistent like them.‚Äù

That whimsical love for Fred‚Äôs also goes for its employees. Christina Stricker was 5 when she had her first Fred‚Äôs fish from the Somerset location. Now 47, she rings up such memories at many a Fred‚Äôs register, including the one on North Zarzamora.

‚ÄúThe fish has not changed,‚Äù Stricker said, then added with a laugh. ‚ÄúThe atmosphere hasn‚Äôt changed.‚Äù

What will change for Fred‚Äôs is how customers can express their appreciation for the chain beyond just picking up another three-piece fish to-go.

For the first time, Fred‚Äôs will sell branded T-shirts. Those should be out in the next couple of months, just in time for Fred‚Äôs third Fiesta medal release. Fred‚Äôs also is looking into food delivery services such as Grubhub for those who‚Äôd rather reel in their orders from home or work. And they‚Äôll have a new website soon with more food photos and information.

In the meantime, Fred‚Äôs Fish Fry looks to just keep on keeping on with the same no-frills formula that‚Äôs made it the biggest little seafood chain in San Antonio, despite one whopper of a fish tale about how they do it.

I don't know if that pricing will last if Google Fiber never arrives to compete though.

According to Animal Care Services, employees at a local recycling plant were inspecting a train shipment from Mexico on Thursday and found a scared 4-year-old female Australian Shepherd mix in an open-top railroad car.

ACS officers were called to the site after employees at the plant said the pup, who was later named Lana, wouldn't move from the 9-foot high railroad car.

""It is a mystery how this girl got herself into this situation,"" said Lisa Norwood, public information officer for ACS. ""The car was so high and closed from all four sides.""

Officers climbed into the railroad car and eventually pulled the frightened dog out of the railcar using a makeshift harness, ACS said in a Facebook post on Monday. She was transported to ACS and was adopted the next day.",0,1

893,"I think this is pretty spot on.  Around 10 years ago I had left San Antonio to go to school in Austin and at the time San Antonio couldn't hold a candle to the type of young urban life someone living in Austin could have.  

That's all changed I feel like over the last 5 years.  Even after I came back to SA after college there wasn't much to do in San Antonio.  Every bar seemed to be located in a strip mall.  Their weren't as many running/bike trails.or general events that weren't typical old San Antonio traditions like Fiesta.

I feel like there's been a cultural renaissance in San Antonio as the inner city has been revitalized with redevelopment.  It's good to see because in my youth downtown appeared to be dying.  There are buildings with beautiful old architecture that at the time were just sitting in wait to be condemned. There's still a few of those but I've seen some renovations recently. Youth events in general have increased not just geek events, but music festivals and craft beer as well.

Tech jobs in San Antonio are still lagging as Rackspace hasn't been doing too hot lately. Other areas in tech in San Antonio seem to revolve around DoD military or healthcare.  It's still improving.

911,"It sounds reasonable on the surface, but the end result is the increasingly unsustainable level of wealth inequality in our country. When workers are atomized into individual contract signers with employers it creates a vast power imbalance. But with a union, workers can band together to advocate for their interests on a more level playing field. Without any unions, you get a race to the bottom as profit-seeking drives downward pressure on wages.

The only exceptions are high skilled, high in-demand industries (like tech) where workers can get away with demanding high salaries. That's great for knowledge workers, but our society also needs janitors, gas station attendants, shelf stockers, and other roles where profit-seeking capital has driven wages below cost of living in many areas.",0,0

Why do you feel the need for gratification and support from a man you don't know and will never meet? I still stand behind my statement that people are looking for things to get offended about, and it's a damn shame. That's like saying it's my birthday and I get a phone call telling me I should eat cake. Sure it may be unconventional, but I'm sure as hell not gonna get upset over something so petty. The fact that they took the time out to even call is better than what most people do. I realize it's his job, but be grateful he even talked about it. I personally believe women's day, black history month, Hispanic heritage, and the lot are very sorry holidays. It's saying ""we were mistreated so now recognize us"" well maybe it would go a lot more smoothly if instead of boasting about it you fight for true equality. Don't expect men to open doors for you or not hit you when you swing first. I was raised a gentleman of Texas quality, but after experiencing life and the equality fights, it's only fair to have TRUE equality or none at all. That being said, you don't need a holiday to stamp your mark on history ""you know it, I know it, everybody knows it"" therefore it can only be used as a medium to attract sorrow and attention.

991,"Yes. Well. I think. Everyone should have to go thru a ""test run""....let's say it's one mile. Granted the app would have to know light schedules or exactly when lights change, know exactly where stop signs exists, where exactly the sidewalk borders the road and track balance of the individual on every scooter, and sensory devices to audio and proximity to objects.  
So....with in a mile the scooter checks if you pass simple rules of the road.  
Stop at stop signs.  
Stop at red lights.  
Use turning lanes appropriately or method of crossing intersections.  
Whether you are consistently balanced.  
When and where you use your speed, ie if it just rained recently, it knows and checks that you slow down on turns so you dont slip out at max speed.  
If you are riding in the street to the right of traffic or if you're on the walk.  
As far as sensory to pedestrians that could be tough but it is also doable.  
Just a matter of geolocation every meter post and every sign post and every traffic light and street light. Then an algorithm to detect two posts moving in any direction (pedestrians).  

I believe this all totally could be accomplished. Though, instead of a sensory device for proximity to pedestrians, why not one that senses when the scooter crashes, and auditory sensor for screams or yells of 'wtf are you doing?' 'Watch where you're going!'   

If users cant accomplish these tasks within a mile, you cant ride.  The app suggests using a ride share option.  

And, honestly, destination should be required. The app will save common places you regularly visit so you dont have to re-enter them if you're a regular user. But if it's under half a mile, it should point out it would be better to walk. I would say you should have to enter your height &amp; weight on the app as well, and to protect against lawsuits of weight discrimination, the scooter detects weight of the rider too. So, if someone is short and overweight by national health standards, and trying to go a very short distance, the app points out suggesting to walk.  

There are loads of ways to implement the technology that is available to make them safer and prevent those who have 0 skill or common knowledge of how to operate something similar to a bicycle in public and among half ton to 3 ton vehicles.

The [job description](https://jobwebextprod.neisd.net:444/ltmprod/CandidateSelfService/) of this role seem to suggest that the person will be expected to do at least some level of security troubleshooting.

These aren't bad pay grades for System Administrators who have a locality requirement to be in the San Antonio area only, however with COVID opening up WFH options, they are not going to be competitive with the US as a whole. When you throw in Security focus as an additional requirement, you can assume that bumps up a candidate's salary expectations by at least 20-25%. 

Simply put, if they want a good security person, they're going to have to pay more. Or try to hire a very cheap CISO with the T10 director level pay.",0,0

Second, I would start documenting the date of each fall in a note on your phone.  The reason for this is that when your relative eventually has an incident and you have to talk to an EMT or a doctor in the ER, you will be able to hand them your phone and show them the relative's history at a glance.  Doctors and EMT's like this type of objective data that they can review quickly.  You can also include a list of the relative's medications.

Not all trump supporters are white supremacists but white supremacists are much more likely to be a Trump supporter then a Biden supporter. Violent and non-violent white supremacist groups alike are very vocal Trump supporters. 

If there‚Äôs a massive Trump rally, the chance that one or more violent white supremacist is there is higher then any other public gathering (aside from a straight up kkk meeting).

I have been called a kike multiple times while walking my dog while wearing my Jewish star necklace, I have had swastikas painted on my door more then once. When I was living in the Boston area two years ago, significantly more liberal, there was attempted arson on two rabbi‚Äôs houses just 10 minutes away from me. Just recently, a rabbi was stabbed in a hate crime near my old Boston neighborhood. A group of white supremacists yelled ‚ÄúThe Jews will not replace us‚Äù while counter protesting in Charlottesville just a few years ago. The Tree of Life synagogue shooting was the largest massacre of Jews in the USA. All of this and more happened during Trump‚Äôs presidency. 

Do I know that every person perpetrating those hate crimes was a Trump supporter? No, I can‚Äôt be certain. But hateful people felt emboldened during his presidency and that‚Äôs terrifying to me. 

Am I biased? Clearly. But that doesn‚Äôt make my lived experience any less real or the FBI‚Äôs data any less factual.",0,0

the area itself isn‚Äôt horrible, like vista ridge is over by utsa and la cantera which is mainly full of college students and professionals. Like idk, Ive definitely waddled home from a bar back to my apartment less than 2 miles from where that one is without giving a damn. Unfortunately it just seems the cheap apartments in that area lack security cameras / staff who care about theft/maintenance/literal intrusion. 

If you‚Äôre living alone and are open to sacrificing that privacy for a more secure location, I would recommend a Facebook San Antonio Roommates group? You can make a post about who you are, your situation, what you‚Äôre willing to spend, what you want in a roommate and all of that. People will comment if they‚Äôre interested , you can get a vibe on them, then y‚Äôall can work on finding somewhere that offers more security that y‚Äôall could manage together. 

You can also just scroll through other posts, lots of landlords post rooms to houses they own. One of my friends went that route and he lived in 2 story, fully furnished, 4 bed, 3 bath house in a new neighborhood for around 750 a month in that area? Shared it with 3 other random roommates but they kept to themselves except for when they were in public areas and down to vibe. Landlord also had ring cameras and a good cleaning policy :)

1173,"Funny how you say that, since sociology is one of the fields that marxism has decided to influence most of all. Because it is a very soft science, it has been easy for them to influence. But the fact that marxist theories gets spread within the domains of a university does not automatically mean that marxism becomes science. What is science is determined by Philosophy of Science - you can read more about that here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy\_of\_science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_science)

So in short - NO, marxist theories on perpetuation of poverty does not become science just because you found something about that on Google. Sure there is something to it - if someone keen on learning could never get to the library, and if there was no Internet or no book stores, maybe they would never learn anything and become what they can be. But in practice that problem hardly exists. Political measures today is mostly about throwing money away on projects that almost never generate any measurable results, just so politicians can win votes by showing how ""good"" their intentions are.

Enough about that. Again, NO, the reason why many ""homeless"" people has been seen in SA is NOT that the city is too difficult to walk in. On the contrary - criminals who have lost their driving license due to drugs and other crime will move their hustling to cities where the weather is good and it is easy to get around by walking.

1184,"More concerts have been canceled as tensions escalate between musicians and management of the San Antonio Symphony.

‚ÄúRussian Masters‚Äù on Nov. 19-20, ‚ÄúBeethoven‚Äôs ‚ÄòEmperor‚Äô Concerto‚Äù on Nov. 26-27, and ‚ÄúHolidays at The Majestic‚Äù on Dec. 18 have all been canceled by the Symphony Society of San Antonio, the board that oversees the orchestra‚Äôs operations.

According to Symphony spokesperson Kimberly Maldonado, ‚ÄúSan Antonio Symphony Box Office representatives will contact all ticket holders directly over the phone in the coming days to ensure they understand next steps and all ticketing options.‚Äù

Following the Sept. 27 declaration of a strike by the Musicians of the San Antonio Symphony, the season-opening concerts of Oct. 28-29 and Nov. 5-6 were also canceled, with musicians periodically leafleting and picketing outside their main performance venue, the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts.

The dispute deepens
---

The latest development in the ongoing dispute is a charge by the Symphony Society filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Oct. 29, alleging bad-faith bargaining by the American Federation of Musicians (AFM) Local 23, which represents the musicians in contract negotiations for the national union.

The Symphony Society‚Äôs charge follows an earlier NLRB charge filed by AFM Local 23 on Oct. 25, alleging that the Symphony Society has engaged in unfair labor practices and bad-faith bargaining. When management informed the union it was canceling musicians‚Äô health and other benefits on Oct. 28, the union added ‚ÄúRepudiation/Modification of Contract‚Äù to its earlier charge.

John Ferguson, the attorney representing orchestra management, said the Symphony Society‚Äôs charge is not a counter-charge but is wholly independent of the union‚Äôs earlier charge.

‚ÄúEven if the union hadn‚Äôt filed their charge, I think the symphony probably would have filed their own,‚Äù Ferguson said.

A major part of the charge alleges that the union did ‚Äúnot [live] up to the letter and spirit of the parties‚Äô agreement to first attempt to use interest based bargaining,‚Äù and refused to accept mediation by Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service commissioners.

Interest-based bargaining (IBB), also known as mutual gains bargaining, is a negotiation strategy meant to avoid adversarial bargaining, opting instead for ‚Äúconsensus-seeking and cooperative‚Äù negotiations.

David Van Os, attorney for the musicians, said mediators present for the earlier IBB negotiation sessions showed bias toward management, in part because the musicians were not allowed to focus on the 80% pay cuts they had endured during the height of pandemic cancellations in 2020.

‚ÄúWhen we were trying to explain the background leading up to here, one of those mediators told us that that was just all baggage and that she didn‚Äôt want to hear about it,‚Äù Van Os said.

‚ÄúThey want a mediator so badly, that they must think that a mediator will convince the union to agree to their demands,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄòRocks in their head‚Äô
---

The Symphony Society charge further accuses the union of negotiating in bad faith, refusing to continue negotiations, and imposing conditions for a return to bargaining.

Van Os called the charge an attempt to deflect attention from the union‚Äôs earlier charge. ‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre charging us in bad faith, they‚Äôve got rocks in their head.‚Äù

The union has called for management to rescind the contract imposed on Sept. 26 before negotiations can continue. The contract matches management‚Äôs ‚Äúlast, best, final offer,‚Äù which reduces the number of full-time musicians in the orchestra from 71 to 42, fills 26 other positions with part-time musicians, and makes drastic wage cuts of 33% for full-timers and what union members have described as ‚Äúpoverty level‚Äù annual wages of $11,000 for part-timers.

Van Os said the two sides met last week for a grievance session outside the formal negotiations, and the union told management ‚Äúif you will withdraw that [last, best, final offer] label ‚Ä¶ and if you will agree to rescind the unilaterally imposed conditions, we will be happy to come back to the bargaining table. But we‚Äôre not going to do it unless it‚Äôs on an equal playing field.‚Äù

Ferguson, once an attorney for the NLRB in the 1980s, said, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not the way it works in bargaining. We‚Äôre not asking the union to call off their strike as a condition to return to the table.‚Äù

He said management might well be willing to move away from its last, best, final offer, but nothing can be determined until the two sides return to negotiations.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll consider all proposals ‚Ä¶ and hopefully arrive at some kind of mutually agreeable contract. Both sides are going to have to move ‚Äî the Symphony realizes that they may have to move from their last best and final. ‚Ä¶ They may very well move. But we won‚Äôt know that until we get to the table and negotiate.‚Äù

The law is clear, Ferguson said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt condition bargaining.‚Äù

Ferguson said the imposed contract applies only to the third year of the original three-year contract negotiated in 2019 and does not bear on future contracts. But Van Os said agreeing to the imposed contract terms for even the remainder of the 2021-2022 season would prove disastrous for the symphony.

‚ÄúWe believe that we would never be able to get the symphony to get off of them if we agreed to them. They are completely intolerable. They will destroy the San Antonio symphony,‚Äù Van Os said. ‚ÄúAnd it looks to me like right now, the board is trying to destroy the symphony. This is their doing, and it will be their historical legacy.‚Äù",0,0

They respect your time.

They are willing to work with you on payment and prices. Their word and handshake mean something.

They also employ a smith who can work on any kind of stone or metal - so repairs, modification, or fabrication are all possible.  Perhaps change your ring into something new and cool? All for a fair price and in a timely fashion.

Ask for Quinn. His masters is in Art History and he used to teach at UTSA before taking on the business full time with his mother after his father passed a few years ago.

It's all indie developers like two developers that I know that formed a company called [3D Generation](http://3d-generation.com/). I also have another buddy of mine who is working made his own games but now is working from his home with another company that's doing a MMO.

If you're a Palo Alto, I'd recommend taking some game design classes at Northwest Vista. Those guys from 3D Generation were part of a group that beat out hundreds of other colleges with their game and went to E3 last year - http://2013.e3insider.com/exhibitor/view/621/alamo-colleges-northwest-vista-college

Like someone else mentioned, St. Mary's University is also getting praise for their video game design graduate program - http://www.princetonreview.com/top-graduate-schools-for-video-game-design.aspx

But other schools in the state, especially SMU, are considered the ideal places to go. 

I've been in Austin and spoken with plenty of developers, and it's just not the same kind of scene as say San Francisco. There are several sites for major companies like EA, Blizzard, and BioWare, but that's not their ""main"" studio. There's plenty of indie developers there, but still, it's not this video game Mecca like some try to make it. Sadly, GDC Online moved out of Austin and that was a great place to check for jobs with those companies. 

Look, unless you have some experience or a degree, it's going to be hard to get a food in the door. I'd recommend jumping on the Northwest Vista Program because it's cheap but is a quality education, and look to transfer to a good undergraduate program to finish up. In the mean time, start creating something. I know that the Unity engine is ridiculously cheap and maybe even free for students. I've been told that's a great engine to start off with and make some games on your own and even see about getting it on Google Play store. 

Another option is modding. There are plenty of examples of people that modded a game and were given jobs. If you can get your hands on some modding tools for a game you enjoy, try to create something special and get some attention. If you go to a studio with a degree and some samples of your work, you're going to be much better off. Good luck!

The top Republicans are scumbags who want this end too, but they won't act as quickly to get there because they seem to not have the same level of audacity to spit in their voters' faces and gaslight them about things they say they do want they actually do the opposite.

Learn about these things, don't take my word for it.  And don't use Google (or DuckDuckGo) if you don't want the CIA's official propaganda.  Again, this sounds crazy but take 10 seconds to look and your eyes will start opening.

1403,"I live in this apartment complex. And I definitely wouldn't recommend it. In the six months I've lived here, we've had a break-in on a Sunday during the day when we weren't home, a shooting that happened a couple of buildings away with no details that I know of on it. And we also had another notice that there was a shooting where someone fired a gun into the air.

On top of that, it's really not a very aesthetic place to live. They've promised to put in grass in the lower area, and it still turns into nothing but mud every time it rains and looks terrible. Yes, the parking is also pretty bad during the evenings.  Also, the apartments are quite old. Most were built in the 70s, except for the one in the front building where it burned a year or two ago and they completely renovated it.  (They say that some of their apartments are renovated, and really this is the only one that I've seen that is. Because it burned down.) if you do a Google search for it you'll find it. 

I still have half of a year left on my lease in this place. And I definitely won't be renewing it. Their maintenance team tries hard, but they take 2 to 3 days to show up. When our apartment was broken into, the door latches were replaced but they didn't fit properly, and every time there was any kind of humidity in the air, our door wouldn't lock easily from the outside and it took them a couple of days to get here. So I almost had to risk not locking my door when I would leave. 

There are some other things that I've noticed about this place, like the stray cats, the garbage area that just sits outside, but take my advice and look somewhere else to live. It's not terrible, it's definitely not the cheapest place, but there are a lot of other nicer places that I have seen around here. The only reason I moved in here is that I was looking for a place with very little advance notice and it was the only place that had apartments available. ",0,0

After looking at some cool art, grab a drink at The Luxury across the street, and continue walking up the riverwalk where you'll end at The Peal. Grab a great lunch there and drink some more. I recommend a cocktail or two at Hotel Emma. 

From there get an Uber/Lyft up to the Witte Museum and then go stroll around Brackenridge Park or even the Zoo, stopping by the Japanese Tea Garden. From there walk to Augies BBQ and have a great dinner.

Electric car maker Tesla is negotiating with local commercial real estate firm Concord Properties on a long-term lease that would allow the company to open its first showroom in San Antonio after previous attempts have fallen through or been rebuffed by local officials.


San Antonio‚Äôs City Council approved a request Thursday from the property‚Äôs current owner, tech pioneer David Monroe, to rezone the lot at 23011 W. Interstate 10, across from Dominion Country Club to allow for motor vehicle sales on the premises. Monroe is selling the land to Concord.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a brand with global cache, and it‚Äôs one that adds a shine to the work and innovation and technology that many of our companies and businesses are doing,‚Äù said District 8 Councilman Ron Nirenberg, whose district would include the showroom. Nirenberg‚Äôs office confirmed the negotiations.

San Antonio lags behind other major cities in its availability of retail businesses and infrastructure for electric vehicles. So far, Tesla‚Äôs presence is limited to four chargers in the downtown area and one near The Shops at La Cantera, all of them in hotels and four for patrons only, according to its website. It has six showrooms elsewhere in Texas: two in Houston, two in Dallas, one in Austin and one in Fort Worth.


Tesla has tried twice before to open a showroom in San Antonio. Early last year, it started an effort to open one on the far Northeast Side, and City Council granted approval to rezone the property. But the automaker apparently abandoned its plans.

Last summer, Tesla released plans for a showroom along Interstate 10 near The Rim. The city Zoning Commission rejected the proposal, citing concerns that the company‚Äôs electric car batteries could contaminate the Edwards Aquifer.

Tesla later pulled the request from consideration by City Council; the new location is not in the aquifer‚Äôs recharge zone. It briefly opened a pop-up shop at The Shops at La Cantera last year.

Tesla spokeswoman Alexis Georgeson didn‚Äôt respond to requests for comment on Thursday.

Tesla, led by visionary tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, has struggled to gain a foothold in Texas, where laws prohibit it from selling vehicles directly to customers.

The showroom would join several auto dealerships on the booming Interstate 10 corridor. The showroom would differ from traditional auto dealerships in that visitors to its showrooms can check out the cars, but they have to buy them online or out of state.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a corridor that‚Äôs accessible from the major metropolitan areas in central Texas,‚Äù Nirenberg said. It is ‚Äúone of the fastest growing regional corridors in the country.‚Äù

For years, CEO Elon Musk has waged a lobbying campaign to persuade state lawmakers to let Tesla bypass traditional dealerships and sell cars in its stores. But the effort has faced opposition from auto dealers, and bills to allow direct sales have died before making it to a vote.

Tesla won an important battle in May when the Texas Republican Party voted to change its platform to support letting companies sell vehicles directly to customers, according to news reports and the website of ‚ÄúTesla in Texas,‚Äù which touts the company‚Äôs position.

Bexar County appraised the property at just over $1 million. It includes a 12,700 square-foot building that was originally a Ducati motorcycle dealership and previously served as the headquarters of Monroe‚Äôs cybersecurity company, E-Watch. Monroe owns the site through his company Unobtanium Property Solutions LLC.

That's the only location as far as I know.  
  
Info from a quick google
  
&gt;   Many cars, motorcycles, boats, aircraft and tools have engines that run worse, or have parts that deteriorate, when run on gasoline that contains ethanol. In addition, ethanol leaves residue on valves and other parts that can hinder performance.  
  
---

&gt; Pure gas gives better mileage than E10, and much better than E85, simply because gasoline has higher free energy than ethanol. The free energy of gasoline is 34.2 MJ per liter. The free energy of ethanol is 24.0 MJ per liter. That means E10 (10% ethanol) has a free energy of 33.2 MJ per liter, and E85 (85% ethanol) has a free energy of 25.6 MJ per liter. As a result, **your mileage is reduced by 3% with E10 over pure gas**, and 25% with E85 over pure gas, all else being equal. Mileage will be reduced even more if your engine doesn't run as well on E10, which is often the case with older vehicles.  
-https://www.pure-gas.org/about  
  
Basically, 20% more cost for 3% more energy. Its not cost effective from a fuel efficiency point of view. ",0,1

Unique: I moved here from Austin and was immediately struck by how much more history is apparent here. For context, San Antonio will celebrate its 300th anniversary this year at Fiesta. The Spanish Missions predate the American revolution by a couple generations. In contrast, everything in Austin feels bright and new -- part of its ""weird"", progressive, and tech-oriented culture. I don't mean that in a negative sense -- Austin's a fun town, but San Antonio feels much older than just about anywhere else in Texas. It's one of the things I've come to love about it.

Pros: Great museums and parks, cost of living is low (for now), lots of space, small town feel in a big city

Cons: Segregation, ""old money"", and abysmal funding for public education. IMHO, these go hand in hand, as property taxes determine how well (or poorly) local schools get funded. This effectively makes public schools like Alamo Heights ISD the equivalent of a private school, as families who want to send their kids to those programs have to afford a home in the ISD (a quick search will show you that houses in ""desirable"" ISDs tend to be much more expensive than those in the San Antonio ISD). 

Changes: Growth, and with it, gentrification. Most of the development seems to be on the north side of the city, though some efforts are being made to revitalize downtown. It wouldn't surprise me if more people start to look here as Austin becomes more and more expensive.

Passion: Spurs, big military community, Mexican culture, Bill Millers and Whataburger, Fiesta

Staple Dishes: Chili con carne, Tex-mex and ""interior"" Mexican food, some barbecue (though more of an emphasis on barbacoa). There's an interesting and insightful article/essay on how this plays out into the cultural differences between San Antonio and Austin here: https://endofaustin.com/2016/09/22/breakfast-taco-wars-race-history-and-food-in-austin-and-san-antonio/

Food Scene: Becoming more eclectic and ""modernized"" to attract and serve a growing young professional / ""hipster"" population. The Pearl houses a Culinary Institute of America campus that has been turning out excellent chefs who want to introduce new restaurants and shops in the city. Cured is one of the more famous newer spots in the city -- the head chef was nominated for a James Beard award. Lots of local favorites for tacos, from the more ""Austin"" style (Torchy's Tacos) to more traditional Mexican (Taquitos on West Ave).

You‚Äôre talking about propaganda, which isn‚Äôt a new concept and isn‚Äôt one-sided.

Anyone and any organization can (and does) use social media to advance their agenda.

&gt;Well the number of apprehensions being made at the border is actually at an all time low.

You‚Äôre basing that on old information that was being thrown around back in January.

Apprehensions have increased dramatically since then.

&gt;However in the past anyone who was caught at the border or immigrants caught within the United States, were quickly processed and released. 

Those who didn‚Äôt claim asylum were quickly deported.

&gt;Trump is now holding more of them.  With more of the immigrants being held, we're running out of places to put them.

That‚Äôs not quite accurate.  More are being apprehended at the border then in the past and it takes time to process their asylum claims, which requires the manpower to do so.

The facilities are overwhelmed *because* so many are seeking asylum.",0,0

1579,"Haven't seen anyone comment about this, so here goes:

In the background of the video, some individual is seen holding a phone possibly filming the altercation from another angle. This same individual then follows the assailant out of the restaurant.

Inquiring minds would like to know: Who was that person? Did they record anything that should be known? 

Either way, the assailant is fucked. The Internet never forgets. His shit-for-brains actions cost him whatever future he had. Given his prior arrest record, that means his employability now is nil. 

So the kid was wearing a MAGA hat...big deal. Suppose the assailant didn't like the Spurs and the kid was wearing a Spurs jersey?

1587,Thanks for all the information Guys I really appreciate it. I looked on google the route from around the 410 loop to new braunfels because I plane on staying with Walmart because the 3 day schedule and pay. I currently drive 45 mins to work now so it‚Äôs actually a shorter drive. My schedule is 6am-630pm so I am usually up and leaving around 4:30am (I like to be to work early) so I think mostly anywhere traffic wouldn‚Äôt be such an issue at that time. My girl and I have talked it over and she supports my move. I knew we are young but I‚Äôm fully committed as she is (almost 2 years together). I‚Äôm probably not an average 19 year old as five been through a lot in my life. I think everything will be ok when I move (moving from Delaware lol) just as long as I have the money and job. I plan on keeping my job and and just getting an easy part time job there which you can get anywhere for extra income.  I don‚Äôt need any nice apartment just as long as it‚Äôs not trashy ya know she‚Äôs checked over there around the 410 loop and said some prices can be from 650-900 for 1/2 br which I find reasonable depending on how nice it is. I plan on visiting before I come sometime in spring when I get my tax returns. She says the river walk and zoo are nice to visit there. I‚Äôm from a small town so adjusting probably will happen. My school had barely under 1k students and my graduating lads was like 220. Probably never will have seen someone from Delaware out there or Delaware tags. Can‚Äôt wait to see the reactions. With all that said thanks for all the help and information I really appreciate! I‚Äôve been wanting to ask some people about it from there but don‚Äôt know a single person there lol. Thanks again everyone it‚Äôs much appreciated and helps out a lot!,0,0

1611,"Maybe you just moved in to my neighborhood.  We're 94 homes I think.  $120/quarter plus a $400 road assessment fee.  No amenities other than a gate.  So that's $880/yr.

Seemed expensive to me so I ran for the HOA board and now that I'm on the board seeing the expenses, basically shits expensive.

Stupid landscaping is about $1600/month cause we have to mow &amp; maintain grass that's behind half the homes fences along a main road.  Kind of silly.

We've got some kind of drainage pond and that cost is another $400/month to maintain.

Then there's security cameras, which has to have internet service, so there's another $50/month.

And the stupid gate itself, you know how people can call you on that gate?  Well that means it has to have phone service, so that's basically another $50/month.

And the street lamps need power, so does the gate, and the security cams, so that's another $50/month in electricity.

Then we've got to get the common area trees trimmed, but that has to be done by a certified arborist so that's another whatever the hell that costs.

I'm sure you're heard about how AT&amp;T is doing away with 3G, well our stupid gate system for some reason only works with AT&amp;T and wouldn't work after the 3G goes away so we have to upgrade that damn thing which cost us about $2k.  Got 3 different places to quote it and $2k was the best we could do.  


And on top of all of that we use some property management company to handle all the petty bullshit above, and I think that's something like $400-600/month.  There's developments happening around us and we're having to pull in a lawyer now for consultation too and that's just more and more money :(",0,0

Additionally, positions for fully remote are way more competitive. This might also impact the amount of denials.

I‚Äôm not sure about paying someone to optimize your resume. I would recommend tailoring your resumes for the roles you‚Äôre applying to and definitely include keywords that align with the position. This means having several versions of resumes that highlight your experience and knowledge for the desired role.

- This post is about an employer imposing this rule, not the government. It's an 'at will' employment state. Their company, their choice... they can fire you for any or no reason at all. They can probably do lots of things that the workers may not like.
- Vaccines aren't *just* about your body, you can harbor the disease, grow it in your body, allow it to mutate, and then spread it to others. So it's more like... your safety, my choice. 

I get the whole, its not as thoroughly vetted as other things... but the tech has been so heavily researched, and it has been quite rigorously tested.

**Herd Immunity**

One of the most common questions I see is ‚Äúwhen will we hit herd immunity?‚Äù

I may be an oddity, but I do not think it‚Äôs an important number to focus on.  Here is why.

Herd immunity is not the end of the outbreak, it is the turning point.  Mathematically, herd immunity is defined as the point when the number of infected people begins to decline.  But infections will continue to occur, and people will continue to die.

Herd immunity is highly variable over time, and it is very dependent on our behaviors.  If the public completely locked down, isolated, and wore hazmat suits all the time, herd immunity would be a very low threshold.  If the public frequently attend large, packed gatherings in enclosed spaces without any protection, the herd immunity threshold would be extremely high.

In fact, we‚Äôve already achieved herd immunity a number of times as our behaviors have varied widely and infections peaked and then declined.  The three easily visible peaks occurred in April 2020, July 2020, and January 2021.  We‚Äôre now seeing an uptick in cases, probably due to relaxed behaviors, and despite the vaccination efforts.

So, rather than focusing on a very hard to measure herd immunity threshold, I think it‚Äôs better to focus on the eradication threshold.  It‚Äôs an end point, and it‚Äôs much easier to measure: cases go to zero for a sustained period.",0,0

Like it or not, scientists are saying one thing and many big name politicians are saying the opposite, and for someone without a high school diploma, they might not think this is a question of science but rather of public policy.

I watched in horror as contractors for spectrum AND AT&amp;T did this. In this case the only possible benefit you have from fiber is lower latency. You‚Äôre still sharing bandwidth (which may be adjusted on a building/node basis) so if you open up multiple devices google will start to open multiple channels. The end result *is* gigabit internet but it does take a minute. As other people have said it might (probably is) your hardware. Gamers spend over $200 on nighthawk modem/routers that can open more channels faster and give you a higher throughput. WiFi is almost always going to be slower than a wired connection, if you have more devices + Bluetooth + neighbors all have WiFi, you may be able to tweak a little by changing the WiFi channels you‚Äôre using.

1745,"Yep.  It does nothing to actually diagnose and solve the problem.  Having a lay person do those things gives the potential for them to seriously damage the coil.  Changing the filter is never a really bad idea if it needs changing BUT unless it is completely clogged with crap it's not going to make that big a difference.

Also, what is on the coil?  Is it dirt?  That implies a bigger problem if it's dirt and dust buildup.  A problem with the ducts.  Is it growth they are cleaning off?  If so it's going to be back and it's probably permeated every single part of that HVAC system ( including the ducts and their home ).  That requires a whole slew of other things to actually fix the problem.

Two reasons to ice up.  Low on refrigerant and bad airflow.  Two reasons for low refrigerant is a leak or not charged up right to begin with ( how old is the system? ).  Bad airflow is usually a fan problem but can be (rarely) an obstruction problem.

In no way does cleaning the coil and/or changing the filter going to fix those problems and there is a huge possibility that they damage the coil trying to clean it which means big bucks.

The best thing to do is call a professional and find out what the real problem is.  It should take a competent tech about 20 minutes to give a system a once over and another 15-20 to check the refrigerant levels.  In an hour a competent tech can tell you exactly what's wrong.

Call a professional.  Also, sign up for a maintenance plan.  At a minimum they will come out every year ( some do twice a year ) and clean your outdoor coil, check all the electrical systems, check airflow, and give you a list of things that are

A) immediate needs

B) near future needs

C) optional improvements to your system

Nest thermostats as well.  This year ( with tax return )we are installing an Enviropure system.  I replaced the factory installed capacitors myself because the factory ones suck.  I also installed a capacitor booster to both outdoor units to increase longevity of the system.  Short term expenses that pay off when your system lasts an extra 5-10 years.  I've seen it with my own two eyes.  Those that invest in their HVAC system early save a ton in the long run.

1806,"Hey there. I'm a current student and I run the news outlet, so I can give you pretty much everything you need to know. 

First off, the university is spread out over two campuses.  Main campus is 410 and S Zarzamora while the other campus is at Brooks City Base. The Main Campus is where you have mainly the College of Arts and Sciences classes (Biology, communication, English, etc). Over at Brooks City Base is where the College of Business is and that includes the various degres sin computers. Depending on your major/minor, that could mean you'll stay only at one campus or you may have to commute between the two, which takes about 20 minutes. 

Right now there are about 4500 students, with an average age of 30, but that changes in the fall. The university is enrolling freshmen and sophomores for the time, so it'll be an addition 600 students in the fall. 

That said, some of the courses for your major or to get a degree may require you to take classes at one of the Alamo College. Good thing is that TAMUSA will let almost any class transfer because they want more students. 

As for your other questions:

- The university is not ""well respected"" because a lot of people don't even know it exists. Prior to it having a campus, TAMUSA was actually in other buildings across the city. 

- The area of town is fairly empty right now. The nearest house is about a mile away from the actual university. In fact, the university is surrounded by a ranch where horses and cows graze and you'll see the occasional road runner or wild pig.

- Depending on your major, TAMUSA may or may not be the best. I know that our journalism program is on par with anyone else in the city and climbing fast to compete with the mainstays in Texas. Thing is, right now it's not much of a college ""experience"" that I wish some of the younger people would have. It'll get there in the coming years when they have dorms and eventually sports teams, but that's a long ways off. For nontraditional students like me, it's a great way to just get that damn degree without a fuss. 

- The student body is almost entirely from San Antonio, mainly Hispanic. The largest number of students actually come from the northwest side where Northwest Vista is at. There's also a lot of military who mainly make up the non-San Antonio students. I know that the freshmen/sophomore students in the fall will come from more parts of Texas. 

- As of right now there are no dorms and there's not really an apartment complex nearby. Starting in the fall, the university will try and get students into the Tobin Lofts near San Antonio College, but I would avoid that place like the plague because of all the crime that goes on there. You're best bet is searching out a good apartment and just deal with the commute. 

- Since there's not much around the main campus, there's not much to do. A lot of groups hold events at the campus, but since a lot of students commute as well as have jobs and kids, not many stick around for those events.

1813,"Northwoods is our only sheet so ice time is somewhat limited.  There are a few leagues that are played:

* BHL is beginner league on Tuesday's which is a 10 game season that runs about $220 (about to expand to 6 teams though, and possibly a different night or an ultra late game).
* The ARL which is the ""rec league"" that plays on Wednesday/Fridays.  Unsure of season length but it will run about $20/week x duration.
* The AHL which is the competitive league that plays on Thursday/Sunday.  Also unsure of length/cost.

You get a lot of cross over in these leagues due to the limited ice time.  BHL is a newer league that the learn to play sessions were converted into b/c we had so many people.  Unfortunately for you that means you can't just come out and pay $20 for a single session like it was last year.  The shorter season cuts down on the cost a bit though.

If you are having an issue with costs reach out to Dale Henry, he is the hockey director and I'm fairly certain they will let you work out a payment plan if that is what works for you.

You will have to check their schedule (http://northwoodsice.maxgalaxy.net/Schedule.aspx?ID=6) to see when they are having them.

**Herd Immunity**

One of the most common questions I see is ‚Äúwhen will we hit herd immunity?‚Äù

I may be an oddity, but I do not think it‚Äôs an important number to focus on.  Here is why.

Herd immunity is not the end of the outbreak, it is the turning point.  Mathematically, herd immunity is defined as the point when the number of infected people begins to decline.  But infections will continue to occur, and people will continue to die.

Herd immunity is highly variable over time, and it is very dependent on our behaviors.  If the public completely locked down, isolated, and wore hazmat suits all the time, herd immunity would be a very low threshold.  If the public frequently attend large, packed gatherings in enclosed spaces without any protection, the herd immunity threshold would be extremely high.

In fact, we‚Äôve already achieved herd immunity a number of times as our behaviors have varied widely and infections peaked and then declined.  The three easily visible peaks occurred in April 2020, July 2020, and January 2021.  We‚Äôre now seeing an uptick in cases, probably due to relaxed behaviors, and despite the vaccination efforts.

So, rather than focusing on a very hard to measure herd immunity threshold, I think it‚Äôs better to focus on the eradication threshold within Texas.  It‚Äôs an end point, and it‚Äôs much easier to measure: cases go to zero for a sustained period.

To that end, I have added a chart that shows hospitalizations in Texas, as well as a trendline derived from the last 12 weeks.  The title shows the expected number of years to eliminate hospitalizations in Texas given our recent trend.

These time projections can change significantly and rapidly, so don't expect precision or consistency.  Just watch it on a regular basis and over time you should get an idea of the potential time range for eradication.",0,0

2033,"I was actually there when this happened. My girlfriend, daughter and two year old granddaughter went to San Antonio for spring break. The baby wasn‚Äôt feeling good so I carried her until she got too heavy. At that point I put her back in the stroller. That slight delay may have saved us. A few minutes later I heard a loud crack. I‚Äôm an avid outdoorsman and also a retired phone man. I‚Äôve worked lots of storms and I immediately knew what that sound was. I was looking at the tree when it fell. It‚Äôs strange how your mind works when your senses are overwhelmed by adrenaline. I knew that we were far enough away that we were safe. I looked upwards to see if power lines were in the tree limbs and I jumped in front of the stroller to make sure the baby wouldn‚Äôt be injured by fleeing people. I also remember having the irrelevant thought that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not even that windy‚Äù. When the tree actually impacted, it was chaos. I heard a woman screaming. What she said was unintelligible but I heard the word ‚Äúbaby‚Äù. I rushed into the fallen tree after speaking some harsh words to a zoo employee who said that there were power lines in the tree. They were telephone drops-not power lines. After 25 years of building fiber and copper networks, I KNEW what they were. I saw something graphic that I‚Äôm not going to describe. They were being helped and first aid isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm good at. I was looking for injured people who were under the debris. I found a shed that was totally obliterated. I was able to lift a part of it up and I‚Äôm so glad that nobody was underneath it,  because I found two children‚Äôs backpacks right next to it. I looked for a few more minutes and thankfully didn‚Äôt find anyone. As I navigated my way out, I administered another cursing over-you guessed it, power lines. This time to a guest who told me to stay away from them. If you‚Äôve watched the video, I‚Äôm the guy with the  gray ponytail. It turned out, that the family who was injured, lives a few miles away from me. I don‚Äôt know them but the mother works in a school cafeteria. I mention this because that should make it obvious that she isn‚Äôt wealthy. If you can help, please do. There is a Go Fund Me page. I don‚Äôt want to invade the families privacy so you can find it on your own if you look. We left the zoo immediately afterwards. On the drive home I looked at the news. Within 2-3 hours the tree was turned to mulch. Some of the local news outlets said a ‚Äúlimb‚Äù had fallen. They also reported that the zoo‚Äôs EMT team was there within minutes. Maybe 15 minutes. Maybe. I passed them as were leaving the park and wasn‚Äôt at all impressed by their sense of urgency. The fire department and ambulances did get there quickly though.

2093,"&gt;Teachers like you are what is wrong with the system. While I understand being laid back, allowing students to sleep in your class is setting yourself up for a fall. Just wait until someone fails and brings their mom to talk to you about(it happened to several of my profs) and they are not going to care that you were lenient on their child while they are paying thousands of dollars.
&gt;
&gt;As for needing their rest, they would get plenty of it, if they didn't stay on their damn cell phone until 1-2 in the morning. You are also setting these kids up to fail because in the real world, their employer is not going to care if they are tired or not. 

On the contrary, you cannot hold a students' hand and walk them through college, nor can you critique them how to behave as a student. Students learn more responsibility and learn more from their mistakes when they are exposed to such.  This is not high school... this is college. Keep in mind that the student is paying for tuition to be there, they should have the ability to have some leeway on some things. 

In my opinion, sleeping through class is just one of those incidents that the student will eventually learn later on of such consequences.  One incident (where I know, the student is for the most part, a good student, doesn't deserve harsh criticism from me... that's what their parents are/were there for.) If the student continuously becomes less engaged by sleeping then I would be a bit concerned, where I would eventually mention something to such student. 

I apologize, but I wholly disagree with your outlook in higher education. The students themselves should be able to decide where their actions take them.  They will eventually learn that there may be consequences for their actions later down their college career or in their actual career of choice. 

A good example of this would be atudent cheating on an exam/homework. Cheating in itself is deemed an inappropriate academic action on behalf of the student. The consequence of academic dishonesty can be wholly detrimental to the student by essentially being thrown out of the university after ONE incident! Does the student merit such a harsh consequence? This can be subjective depending on the professor/university/department, but if you know the student merits some leeway by them recognizing responsibility for their actions, then why should they be affected for the rest of their life with one bad decision?  While I'm not going to argue against that cheating is not wrong in higher education, it really is, but one decision to cheat does not inherently make that student a bad student, nor do I think academic dishonesty merits automatic expulsion from the university (dependant on case). While college is about receiving an education, that is not solely the reason why students are there. It's about building relationships, learning / being exposed to certain outcomes / consequences and experiencing the independence of being an adult for the first time. ",0,0
