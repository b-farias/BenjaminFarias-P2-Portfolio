Analyzing the sentiment towards transportation in Reddit posts on r/SanAntonio
```{r}
# Initializing tidytext and dplyr libraries
library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stopwords)

# Using reddit data from another class.
redditdata <- read.csv("redditdata.csv", comment.char="#")

# Rearranging data so that there is one work per line and it only contains posts related to transportation
tidy_reddit <- redditdata %>% 
  filter(Transportation == 1) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, Post)

# Remove stop words
tidy_reddit <- tidy_reddit %>% anti_join(get_stopwords())

# Join with sentiment data and count the number of positive and negative words
transportationsentiment <- tidy_reddit %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing"), by = "word", relationship = "many-to-many") %>%
  count(ID, sentiment)

# Get the sentiment from each post by subtracting negative count from positive count
transportationsentiment <- transportationsentiment %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>% 
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)

# Get the average of the sentiment score from the posts
mean(transportationsentiment$sentiment)
```
Based on this analysis, Reddit posts in r/SanAntonio tend to have neutral sentiment towards transportation.
